Welcome to SmArt Colorist!

The adult coloring craze has taken the world by storm!

I have been a "closet" colorist for many years...drawing doodles, only to have them to color...

...Searching the children section of book stores looking for coloring books with any substance.

This blog/vlog will review many of the adult coloring books on the market. I will share coloring techniques, along with tips and tricks. I will review many of the tools used in art coloring, including:

-gel pens  
-colored pencils  
-markers  
-accessories/tools

I will upload completed colorings from my collection. You may also get chance to see my "coloring assistants" -Mazzy and Zuzu (my yorkies) and Kiki (my kitty). You never know when they will be giving me tips on the current coloring. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/abc3ae60-8782-4a3f-9632-9ec1597d149c.jpg)
